version = '0.6.1.3'
versionString = [[Changelog:
	Added common name for Dawnbreaker. Evidently at some point I also added
	Hoodwink and did not mention it.
	
	Added options and methods for punishing cheaters.  At the moment this will 
	kill them if they are alive (or when they become alive) three times per
	cheat. This is mostly due to the fact that the cheaters into which I've run
	typically use -refresh and -respawn.  If they start giving themselves XP
	or gold I'll have to be less lazy.
	
	Properly tracking isEnableCheatRepurcussions now.  Whoops!
	
	Updated neutral item list to be current.  Bot item desires for new items
	are complete crapshoots at this point.	
	
	Updated bot neutral item drop count to five per tier.
	
	Added 'getroles' chat command to dump bot positions to chat. 
	Added bot skill print to RoleDetermination:AnnounceRoles().
