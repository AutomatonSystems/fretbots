version = '0.6.1.0'
versionString = [[Changelog:
	Added common name for Dawnbreaker. Evidently at some point I also added
	Hoodwink and did not mention it.
	
	Added options and methods for punishing cheaters.  At the moment this will 
	kill them if they are alive (or when they become alive) three times per
	cheat. This is mostly due to the fact that the cheaters into which I've run
	typically use -refresh and -respawn.  If they start giving themselves XP
	or gold I'll have to be less lazy.
