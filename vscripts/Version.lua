version = '0.5.3.0'
versionString = [[Changelog:
	Reworked selection of bot roles such that the bots can be used with 
	scripts other than FuriousPuppy's (although preferences are still based
	on the roles from that script.)
	
	Added the barest possible support for Hoodwink (i.e. if she gets picked, 
	this shouldn't crash.)
